Simple Linear Regression: A "TV marketing simple linear regression" describes a statistical analysis using the linear regression method to assess the relationship between the amount of money spent on television advertising ("TV marketing") and a dependent variable like sales, where it aims to identify how much a change in TV ad spend directly impacts the sales figures, essentially showing a straight-line correlation between the two variables.
